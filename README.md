React Components and Hooks that make me happy. 

CSS behind has it's own [repository](https://github.com/polmoneys/mental-model).

## Getting started

```bash

   # Demo
   npm run dev

   npm run build

   npm run serve

   npm run test:unit

   npm run test:unit:coverage

   npm run test:e2e
```

### Inspiration 💐

> Our requirements are more modest but at the same time more responsible: 
> buildings, furniture, drinking glasses may well be consumer items that 
> we can destroy without regret after they have served for some short or 
> long period, but while we use them we expect them to fullfill their role and serve us perfectly, so perfectly that we can also derive aesthetic 
> enjoyment from observing them in use.
