React Components and Hooks that make me **happy**. 

CSS behind has it's own [repository](https://github.com/polmoneys/mental-model).

## Getting started

```bash

   # Demo
   npm run dev

   npm run build

   npm run serve

   npm run test:unit

   npm run test:unit:coverage

   npm run test:e2e
```

### Components overview 

Primitives like **Font**, **Button**, **Input**, **Checkbox** that you can compose into more complex pieces of UI. 

Layout oriented components **Shelf**, **Stack**, **Grid** or **HorizontalScroll**. 

Rich user interactions like **Listbox**, **Tooltip** or **Folder**.

**For** or **Card** to tame content. **Shape** for delight. 

### Hooks overview 


Primitives like **useMq**, **useStyles** or **useSx** for managing utility css classes.

Abstractions to deal with items and how them relate as **useSelectedState** or **useMixedState**.

Finally, the exotic **useNewBrowserTab**. 

### Roadmap 

[-] Improve unit testing

[-] Publish demo

[-] Twitter 🧵🙃

### Inspiration 💐

> Our requirements are more modest but at the same time more responsible: 
> buildings, furniture, drinking glasses may well be consumer items that 
> we can destroy without regret after they have served for some short or 
> long period, but while we use them we expect them to fullfill their role and serve us perfectly, so perfectly that we can also derive aesthetic 
> enjoyment from observing them in use.
